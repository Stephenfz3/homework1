      <p>My name is Stephen Fernandez and I'm 27 years old. I grew up in Miami, Fl my entire life but I come from a Hispanic background; my mother is Puerto Rican and my father is Cuban. During my younger years I was heavily into gaming, I would play almost 10 hours a day just trying to become a professional gamer and win competitions. I had other hobbies such as motocross and ROTC which I enjoyed, but never as much as gaming. Another one of my obsessions is going to dubstep concerts or edm events in general, there's something about how care free you can be at these festivals while also listening to amazing music. As I starting getting older, I fell in love with the tech industry and how a lot of these developers created these applications that most of us can't imagine being without, so that spiked my interest into becoming a web developer and realized how much I actually enjoy this subject.  </p>
